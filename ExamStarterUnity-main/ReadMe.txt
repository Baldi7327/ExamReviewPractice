I modified the two water related shaders we were shown to us in class. 
I did this by combining the two of them into one shader with both effects.
I did this as I felt the waves only flowing with a still image as their
texture didnt look particularily good on its own, and as such I felt
like having the two overlayed and moving textures in combination with 
the waves looked much better. I then used this for the water 
in the recreated scene.
